# Simple Finance App
This project is inspired by the YouTube tutorial [How To Automate Your Finances with Python](https://youtu.be/wqBlmAWqa6A?si=o4ho_91djL6ZXHY0), and showcases how to build a personal finance dashboard using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Streamlit**, and **Plotly**.

The app allows you to upload your own financial transaction data (e.g. from your bank or budgeting app) and get instant insights on your income, expenses, cash flow, and spending habits â€” all in an interactive dashboard.
